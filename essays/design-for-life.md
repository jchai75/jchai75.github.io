## One Size Fits All
"One size fits all." In clothing, this is generally not a good thing to see, but in computer science, the idea is good. Having a solution that can apply to many different problems is good practice because it is efficient. And that is what programmers always strive to achieve: good efficiency. Addressing problems separately will work. You can take the time to do that and you can still fix all your problems. But at what cost? Why not just use good design patters?

## I Need a One Size to Fit All
I have tried my best to implement good design patterns. I try to make things uniform so that I can apply similar solutions to the problems I encounter. This because if I don't, I have to deal with each and every problem individually and develop a unique solution. This is not efficient and time-consuming. Instead, it is better to implement good design patterns so that solutions can be used more efficiently.
