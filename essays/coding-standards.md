  Recently, I have learned some new things about coding standards. I started using ES Lint with IntelliJ for the first time, and I have become more aware of the strictness of some coding standards. At times, the pedantic errors frustrated me because they forced me to change my code to be, to me, less concise and efficient. I felt that my code looked fine before I fixed it to acheive the green arrow of approval.

  However, I understand the need for coding standards. In many computer science courses I have taken, especially the introductory level ones, the professor has enforced a strict coding style standard. If my code did not strictly adhere to the rules given, I was docked points, regardless if my code worked just fine. This made me very aware of the importance of how pretty my code looks, and not just if it works. I learned that pretty code reflects good coding technique, which gives a good impression to people looking at my programs. It shows that I care about how my code looks, and that I take the time to make it look nice.

  Overall, I think that sticking to coding standards is a very important skill to have. However, I do think that it would be easier, at least for me, if they were more standardized. I have learned different coding style standards and have had some trouble switching between them. I do understand that it is hard to establish one overarching standard for all programmers to follow; it's not feasible. Computer science is a complex field; there is always more than one way to do things.
