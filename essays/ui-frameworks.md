## General Thoughts
Generally, I have enjoyed using Semantic UI. After using both Semantic and raw HTML and CSS, I understand the advantages of UI frameworks. Semantic's lanuguage is more intuitive and natural. Because it's closer to regular human language, it was easier to understand. I could truly see how it attempts to make coding more user-friendly. This helps alleviate some of the stress that accompanies learning a new programming language. Just like learning a foregin language, learning a programming language comes with an introduction to new syntax and rules. Relating new material to familiar material helps with the intake of information.
  
## Positive Experiences
One reason why I enjoyed using Semantic is exploring all the pre-made features they have available. It was fun seeing all the different collections and elements and seeing which best fit my needs. If I tried one feature and it didn't work, there was likely another one that could work. Also, the variations on each feature were interesting to look over.


## Negative Experiences
One reason why I struggled a bit with Semantic is the lack of resources. Because it is not as widely used as programming languages, such as javascript, I had some trouble finding help when I needed it. StackOverflow and other helpful sites often had limited content on Semantic, especially when I had a very specific question. However, this did force me to try to fix my roadblocks on my own, instead of relying on other sources, which may have helped build my problem-sovling skills.
