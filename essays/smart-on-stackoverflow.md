## Introduction

  Stack Overflow is the savior of any programmer. It's a place where people feel comfortable posting any type of question relating to coding. However, there is a certain way to ask questions on this forum that proves to be more effective.

## Good Question

  Here is an example of a good question. The title is: "for loop not working as expected with string replacement". It is quite descriptive and lets viewers know the basic idea of the post. Also, within the post, the poster provides examples of what he or she is trying to achieve. This helps potential answerers to get a better idea of the content of the question. THe poster also provides the code he or she has written so far to show his or her current work.
  
## Bad Question
  
  Here is an example of a bad question. The title is: "Create ArrayList from array." The title could be a little more descriptive. However, the main problem with this question is its simplicity. The top answer is just one short line of code. This is a common question, and the poster could have easily found an answer with a quick Google search. Programmers should always try to find the answer to a question on their own before resorting to forums like Stack Overflow.
