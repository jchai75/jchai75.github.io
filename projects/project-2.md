summary: I was an officer for the Japanese Student Association at the University of Washington for two years.
---
  While I attended the University of Washington, I was an officer for the Japanese Student Assocation. As an officer, I worked with fellow officers and the community to plan events and spread Japanese culture. The first year, I was on the Cultural Team, so I focused on planning events that related to Japanese culture. The second year, I was on the Internal Team, which meant I focused on planning other events, such as those in collaboration with other student organizations. Additionally, I was on the Games Team for Matsuri, which is our biggest event of the year. It is a festival that includes food, games, and performances.

  I enjoyed being a part of this organization because it gave me the opportunity to be part of something that I cared about. As someone who was born and raised in Japan, I deeply care about Japanese culture. It gave me a chance to show what I am passionate about. It also allowed me to learn how to work with others. I was constantly working with other officers to plan events, and I gained valuable experience in doing so. I learned the importance of doing my part and providing and listening to feedback. I also learned communication skills, as I was required to correspond with various people and groups to make our events a success.
