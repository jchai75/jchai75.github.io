  During the summer of 2018, I worked at Dr. Takahashi Juku, a tutoring center focusing on test preparation. I taught students from elementary to high school level in math, English, and test preparation. However, I specialized in high school math. Although I only worked there for a few months, I enjoyed the experience and learned a lot.
  This was the first time that I worked a lot with children, so I learned a lot about interacting with them. Each student was different; they had unique personalities and ways that they preferred to learn. It was my job to evaluate this information and use it to most effectively teach the material. I learned that teaching takes a lot of patience; just because the concepts seemed easy to understand to me, it didn't mean it was the same for my students. I had to learn to see things their way in order to best teach them the material. I also learned to work well with other employees at my workplace. I learned to communicate well, such as telling management about the progress of my students.
